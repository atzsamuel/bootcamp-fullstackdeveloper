## Notes about Routers
In this project we learned about routers with dependecy
reat-router-dom in version 6 >

We need to add <BrowserRouter> in index.js in our application
- Routes this component is for very routes and
- Route for define the route

Always user <Link> for not realoading the page
If you use href this action reaload all the page, not recommended
